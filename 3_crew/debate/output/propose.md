The motion to implement H1B wage levels for the lottery, or use the previous year's lottery data without modifications, offers significant advantages over the traditional lottery system. Firstly, establishing wage levels promotes a merit-based approach, ensuring that only the most qualified candidates who are being paid competitive salaries receive sponsorship. This is essential to protect American workers and maintain market integrity, as it prevents employers from undercutting local salaries with low-wage H1B positions. 

Secondly, by utilizing previous year’s lottery data, we can create a more predictable and fair selection process. This prevents the chaos of random selection and fosters a sense of stability for applicants who may rely on these positions for their careers. Companies would be incentivized to offer competitive wages, ultimately elevating the quality of the workforce and contributing positively to the economy. 

Moreover, using wage levels in the lottery process aligns with broader immigration reform goals, reflecting a commitment to attracting highly skilled workers while simultaneously addressing labor market concerns. It mitigates the risk of an oversaturated job market in specific sectors by ensuring that only those positions that meet wage regulations and market demand are filled through the H1B program.

In conclusion, adopting wage levels for the H1B lottery, or relying on data from the previous year's lottery, enhances both the quality of the applicant pool and safeguards the American job market. It is a necessary shift that can lead to greater economic justice, work quality, and overall sustainability in the H1B visa allocation process.
